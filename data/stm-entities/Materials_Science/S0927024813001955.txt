A thin ZnO (<200nm) film grown by Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD) in a matter of minutes was studied as a hole-blocking layer in poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-buyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) based inverted solar cells.
These AALD ZnO layers were compact, had a high electron mobility of 3.4+0.1cm2/Vs, had up to 100% transmittance to visible light, and a good wettability for the blend.
Despite the very rapid, open atmosphere growth method, the cell performance was comparable with some of the best inverted bulk heterojunction P3HT:PCBM cells in the literature.
The performance was also maintained after 200 days of storage in air in the dark.

Highlights
•
ZnO was deposited in under 5min using Atmospheric Atomic Layer Deposition (AALD).
•
AALD is a fast, ambient method that is compatible with roll-to-roll processing.
•
The AALD ZnO was used as the hole blocking layer in organic solar cells.
•
The devices had performances comparable with the highest reported in literature.
•
The low-temperature deposited AALD ZnO can be used in plastic substrate solar cells.
