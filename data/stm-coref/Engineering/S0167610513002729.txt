Dispersion in the near-field region of localised releases in urban areas is difficult to predict because of the strong influence of individual buildings.
Effects include upstream dispersion, trapping of material into building wakes and enhanced concentration fluctuations.
As a result, concentration patterns are highly variable in time and mean profiles in the near field are strongly non-Gaussian.
These aspects of near-field dispersion are documented by analysing data from direct numerical simulations in arrays of building-like obstacles and are related to the underlying flow structure.
The mean flow structure around the buildings is found to exert a strong influence over the dispersion of material in the near field.
Diverging streamlines around buildings enhance lateral dispersion.
Entrainment of material into building wakes in the very near field gives rise to secondary sources, which then affect the subsequent dispersion pattern.
High levels of concentration fluctuations are also found in this very near field; the fluctuation intensity is of order 2 to 5.
Highlights

We relate these dispersion features to the underlying flow structure.
•
The effects of wind direction, building layout and source location are examined.
•
Secondary sources in the near field have a strong effect on the plume spread.
•
Concentration means and fluctuations are mapped and their magnitudes quantified.
