The release of excess volume upon recrystallization of ultrafine-grained Cu deformed by high-pressure torsion (HPT) was studied by means of the direct technique of high-precision difference dilatometry in combination with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and scanning electron microscopy.
From the length change associated with the removal of grain boundaries in the wake of crystallite growth, a structural key quantity of grain boundaries, the grain boundary excess volume or expansion eGB=(0.46±0.11)×10-10 m was directly determined.
The value is quite similar to that measured by dilatometry for grain boundaries in HPT-deformed Ni.
Activation energies for crystallite growth of 0.99±0.11 and 0.96±0.06eV are derived by Kissinger analysis from dilatometry and DSC data, respectively.
In contrast to Ni, substantial length change proceeds in Cu at elevated temperatures beyond the regime of dominant crystallite growth.
In the light of recent findings from tracer diffusion and permeation experiments, this is associated with the shrinkage of nanovoids at high temperatures.
