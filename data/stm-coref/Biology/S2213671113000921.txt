SOX2 is involved in several cell and developmental processes, including maintenance of embryonic stem cells, differentiation of neural progenitor cells, and patterning of gut endoderm.
To study its role in a human system, we generated a human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line harboring a reporter gene encoding GFP in the SOX2 locus.
This SOX2 reporter line faithfully recapitulates expression of the SOX2 gene in undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), neural progenitor cells (NPCs), and anterior foregut endoderm (AFE).
In undifferentiated hESCs, GFP expression corresponds to those cells with highest levels of expression of genes associated with the pluripotent state.
In NPCs, expression of GFP can be employed to isolate cells expressing markers associated with NPC multipotency.
In AFE, we used transcriptome-wide expression analysis to identify cell surface markers with elevated expression in this population, thereby facilitating isolation and purification of this hPSC-derived cell population.
Highlights
A SOX2-GFP hESC line is used to isolate and characterize multiple cell types
A cell surface marker signature allows for the purification of endodermal progeny
Targeted gene insertion with adeno-associated virus (AAV) is highly efficient
SOX2 is expressed during multiple developmental stages.
Brafman, Willert, and colleagues used human embryonic stem cells carrying a SOX2 reporter to characterize its expression in undifferentiated cells and in neural and lung progenitor cells.
This approach led to the identification of a cell surface signature to isolate prospective lung progenitors.
