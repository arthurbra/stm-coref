Whether human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are epigenetically identical to human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) has been debated in the stem cell field.
In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns in a large number of hiPSCs (n = 114) and hESCs (n = 155), and identified a panel of 82 CpG methylation sites that can distinguish hiPSCs from hESCs with high accuracy.
We show that 12 out of the 82 CpG sites were subject to hypermethylation in part by DNMT3B.
Notably, DNMT3B contributes directly to aberrant hypermethylation and silencing of the signature gene, TCERG1L.
Overall, we conclude that DNMT3B is involved in a wave of de novo methylation during reprogramming, a portion of which contributes to the unique hiPSC methylation signature.
These 82 CpG methylation sites may be useful as biomarkers to distinguish between hiPSCs and hESCs.
Highlights
•
Eighty-two DNA methylation sites distinguish hiPSCs and hESCs with high accuracy
•
Twelve aberrantly hypermethylated signature CG sites are due in part to DNMT3B
•
DNMT3B also contributes to previously reported aberrant hypermethylation in hiPSCs
Huang et al. identify a panel of 82 CpG methylation sites that can robustly distinguish hiPSCs from hESCs with high accuracy.
Part of the signature consists of aberrantly hypermethylated CpG sites, which are partially abrogated in the absence of DNMT3B.
In addition, DNMT3B-mutant hiPSCs do not exhibit other aberrant hypermethylation signatures as previously reported.
