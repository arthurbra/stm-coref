# STM-corpus with coreference resolution and knowledge graph population

This repository contains the annotated STM corpus with coreferences, populated knowledge graphs and source code for the paper:

Brack A., MÃ¼ller D., Hoppe A., Ewerth R. (2021) Coreference Resolution in Research Papers from Multiple Domains, ECIR 2021 (accepted for publication). 
- Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00884

## Installation
Python 3.8 required.  Install the requirements with:
- pipenv install

## Datasets

- data/stm-coref: contains the annotated coreferences separated per domain BRAT/standoff format.
- data/stm-entities: contains the annotated concepts separated per domain in BRAT/standoff format (from https://github.com/arthurbra/stm-corpus)
- data/silver_labelled: contains predicted concepts and coreferences of the silver labelled corpus
- data/STM coreference annotation guidelines.pdf: annotation guidelines for coreference annotions in the STM-corpus

## Knowledge Graphs
The folder knowledge_graph/ contains various knowledge graphs.

### Test-STM-KG
- knowledge_graph/gold_kg_cross_domain.jsonl: Test-STM-KG (cross-domain)
- knowledge_graph/gold_kg_in_domain.jsonl: Test-STM-KG (in-domain)
- knowledge_graph/entity_resolution_annotations.tsv: links mentions to Wiktionary and Wikipedia (from https://gitlab.com/TIBHannover/orkg/orkg-nlp/-/tree/master/STEM-ECR-v1.0)

To evaluate the effect of coreference resolution in knowledge graph population against the Test-STM-KG, run the following python script:
- evaluate_kgs_against_test_stm_kg.py: prints the evaluation metrics

### In-domain and cross-domain research knowledge graph 
- knowledge_graph/stm_silver_kg_cross_domain_with_corefs.jsonl: Contains the cross-domain KG populated from 55,485 abstracts
- knowledge_graph/stm_silver_kg_in_domain_with_corefs.jsonl: Contains the in-domain KG populated from 55,485 abstracts
- knowledge_graph/top domain-specific concepts.xlsx: contains the most frequent domain-specific concepts per concept type and domain

### Build knowledge graphs
To build the in-domain and cross-domain Test-STM-KG and the research knowledge graphs, run the following python script:
- build_kgs.py: creates the knowledge graphs in knowledge_graph/

## Use Coref-Models [Under Construction]

### Training

### Evaluation

### Make Predictions
Coreference-clusters in texts can be predicted in the following two ways:
##### 1. ```Model.predict()```
```python
model = BFCRModel()
predicted_clusters = model.predict(texts, domains)
```
##### 2. using the ```predict.py```
Predict.py downloads the best performing model (BFCR_Span_Onto_STM), which is already pretrained, uses it to predict coreference-clusters of the texts stored in the file given. 
```python predict.py "path/to/texts.jsonlines" "Optional-path/to/domains.jsonlines"```

## Visualize predictions:
The predictions can be visualized using [brat](https://brat.nlplab.org/). Creating the files needed for brat to visualize the predicted-clusters can be done in the two following ways:
```python
model.predict(texts, domains, create_standoff_annotations=True)
```
or \
```python predict.py "path/to/texts.jsonlines" "Optional-path/to/domains.jsonlines" --create_standoff_annotations```
